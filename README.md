# Safe Water (client)

Safe Water is a single-page app that allows users to check the levels of contaminants suspected to be present in drinking water, but that do not have health-based standards set under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). We are using data provided by [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/occurrence-data-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule).

The client side of the project is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). You can find the server side [here](https://github.com/groundberry/water-server).
